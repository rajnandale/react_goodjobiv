# ⚡ GOODJOB

Welcome to the **TypeScript** version of our **Job Role Suggestion** website! This project leverages the power of **MERN stack** to help users discover job roles based on their resumes.

## 🖥️ Project Overview

This website suggests possible **job roles** by analyzing your resume. Simply upload your resume document, and our system will perform **keyword analysis** to suggest relevant job roles from our predefined database.

### 🔍 How It Works:
1. **Upload** your resume (supports DOC, DOCX, PDF).
2. The system scans for **keywords** and analyzes the content.
3. **Job roles** relevant to the skills and experience in your resume are suggested.

## 📸 Screenshots

You can enhance your README by adding images or screenshots to provide a visual overview of the project! Below is an example of how to do that:

```markdown
![Homepage Screenshot](./screenshots/homepage.png)
![Resume Upload](./screenshots/upload.png)
```

Simply save your images in a folder like `./screenshots/` within your repository and refer to them in the Markdown using the above format.

## ⚙️ Project Status

This project is still **under development**. We’re continuously working on improving the features and functionality.

### 🌟 Future Directions
We’re planning to integrate **AI-based suggestions** using **ChatGPT Playground** to provide even smarter recommendations for job roles. 🤖
